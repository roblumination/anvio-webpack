This is my HW. I made it for HTML/SASS/JS and Webpack practice.

## How to run

#### 1. You dont want to make changes

1. Make npm install
   `$ npm i`
   <br>
2. Start _serve_ for it
   `$ npm run serve`
   <br>

#### 2. You **_want_** to make changes

1. Make npm install
   `$ npm i`
   <br>
2. Start _watch_ for it
   `$ npm run watch`
   <br>
3. Start your web server

> Q: _Why do i need own web server?_
>
> A: Because `webpack-dev-server` can't handle changes in HTML files, but `webpack watch` can. Idk why ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ .
